		"startIntroPart1": "Glory and nobility to you, fabled King of Bavaria, Ludwig II. Acceding at the age of 18, you would oversee the loss of Bavarian sovereignty to the German unification, yet your reign would one of lasting significance. A King beloved by his people, and a Kingdom idealised in his dreams, your lasting legacy would be your enduring love of beauty and art. The opulent castles of Neuschwanstein and Linderhoff, and your endearing patronage of the operas of Richard Wagner, still stand as testimony to an age of fantasy and fairy tales now lost, and assert the independence of the Bavarian identity of which you epitomized.",
		"startIntroPart2": "King Ludwig, they call you mad, but your madness is the madness of dreams, of poetry and fairy stories. You imagined that the world could be otherwise, that we could build an enchanted kingdom where all seemed tedious and mundane. Oh Swan King, the world has need of your castles and knights, your dragon-haunted mountains and mystical grottoes. Come again, and give us new dreams. Ludwig, the Bavarian Kingdom stands barren of the culture and magnificence that once adorned it. Can you raise great monuments and wonders to the glory of these lands? Can you inspire works of great renown and beauty to strengthen the character of the Bavarian nation? Can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?",
